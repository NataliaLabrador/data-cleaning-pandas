Shark Attacks Mini Project - Natalia Labrador &amp; Juan Fran SÃ¡nchez
We are an environmental consulting firm dedicated to analyze the behavior of sharks in different areas of the world to monitor their activity and make environmental decisions. Our services include accident prevention and early warning to municipal authorities according to the patterns of attacks on the inhabitants of the area. 

In this case, we have received a study on shark attacks recorded worldwide.
They ask us to do a first reading of the records and we have found that they are in complete disarray. Our first task is to clean them thoroughly to be able to detect the patterns of attacks and the most affected areas. Then we have made an analysis comparing all the variables of the dataframe to draw conclusions and be able to implement our strategy in the area of interest.

You can take a look at our notebook to see the cleaning and analysis process, as well as the slides of our presentation with the process explained and the conclusions we have reached.
